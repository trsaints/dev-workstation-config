> __Warning:__ if you assign the custom shortcut to a program, you need to select the program's executable file by providing an absolute path within the filesystem location. You can either hardcode the filepath by hand or select the executable via a File Explorer widget:

After following the provided steps, your shortcuts shoud work as expected. Make sure you either **assign a valid sequence of keys to an existing action/program file executable**.
